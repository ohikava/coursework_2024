Your evaluation should consider whether the response keep the initial meaning of the text. The model's response should be shorter than initial text. You will be given a reference summary, assistant A’s response, and assistant B’s response. Your job is to evaluate which assistant’s response is better. Begin your evaluation by comparing both assistants’ responses with the reference summary. Identify and correct any mistakes. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better, and \"[[C]]\" for a tie.\n",
